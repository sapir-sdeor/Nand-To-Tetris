                           ---------------------------------

## Submitted Files
- README: This file.
- Array.jack: Represents an array
- Keyboard.jack: A library for handling user input from the keyboard.
- Math.jack: A library of commonly used mathematical functions.
- Memory.jack: A library that provides two services: direct access to the computer's main memory (RAM), and allocation and recycling of memory blocks.
- Output.jack: A library of functions for writing text on the screen.
- Screen.jack: A library of functions for displaying graphics on the screen.
- String.jack: Represents character strings.
- Sys.jack: A library that supports various program execution services.

## Remarks
- We added to the classes Math.jack, Output.jack, Screen.jack a static array that saves
the powers of 2 (from 0 to 15). We use this array in the function bit that returns true if the i'th bit of x is 1, otherwise returns false.
- In Screen,jack we divided th drawLine function to the different kinds of lines.
In addition, we added a shiftRight and shiftLeft functions to help us calculate division and multiplication by powers of 2.
- In Output.jack we added the function intLength - calculates the number of digits of the given number.
- In String.jack we added a function intToString that returns a string with the number recieved.
