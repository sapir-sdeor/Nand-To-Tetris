                           -----------------------------------
  

Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
JackCompiler - The executable.
Makefile - A makefile for the project.
JackCompiler.py - Creates a vm file to each jack file with the correct translation.
JackTokenizer.py - Removes all comments from the input stream and breaks it
    		into Jack language tokens, as specified by the Jack grammar.
CompilationEngine.py - Gets input file and translates its parsed code to an
    			output file using the VMTranslator.
VMWriter.py - Writes the code to the output file.
SymbolTable.py - Incharge of the symbol table to the class and to each subroutine.


Remarks
-------
We added functions in the CompilationEngine file to seperate code that is 
repeated in many of the original functions.
Furtheremore, we added a function to the JackTokenizer file to help handle
the comments in the input file.
Also, in the SymbolTable file we added a function to restart the subroutine symbol table.
